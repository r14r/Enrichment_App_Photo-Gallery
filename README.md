# Ionic v3 Tutorial: Photo Gallery app

A tutorial app that walks the user through creating a Photo Gallery app. We begin with the Ionic "tabs" starter app, incrementally converting the About tab to a Photo Gallery experience.

## Structure
Each folder in this repo represents completed source code for each step of the tutorial, available here (TODO - docs link coming soon!).
* part1 - DevApp and Camera: Add basic Camera support. Ability to take one picture at a time.
* part2 - Photo Gallery and Saving to Device: Display multiple photos together in a grid format. Save photos locally to the device.
* part3 - Theming: Explore Ionic's built-in color theming and platform styling capabilities.

## How to Run Locally
* Clone this repo.
* Change directory into any of the "part" folders.
* From a terminal, run "ionic serve".

## Bonus: Exploring Ionic Pro
Build better apps with Ionic Proâ€™s integrated suite of tools and services designed for the entire app lifecycle. In addition to building a photo gallery app, you'll also explore:
* [Ionic Pro Deploy](https://ionicframework.com/pro/deploy): Deliver hot code updates, content changes, A/B tests, and bug fixes in real time before and after your app is in the app stores.
* [Ionic Pro Monitoring](https://ionicframework.com/pro/monitor): Detailed error tracking and monitoring for hybrid apps.
